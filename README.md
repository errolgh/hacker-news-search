## About the Project

Built with 
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html/)
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios/)
- [Thunk middleWare](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk/)

There is no focus on styling the UI beyond visual sanity. The goal for this repo was to explore some of the core concepts of Redux and work with in vogue React features.
